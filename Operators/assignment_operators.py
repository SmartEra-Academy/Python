# Assignment Operators: used to assign values to variables or modify them

a = 10  # Assigns the value 10 to variable 'a'
print(a)  

a += 5   # Equivalent to: a = a + 5
print(a)  

a -= 3   # Equivalent to: a = a - 3
print(a)  

a *= 2   # Equivalent to: a = a * 2
print(a)  

a /= 4   # Equivalent to: a = a / 4
print(a) 

a //= 2   # Equivalent to: a = a // 2
print(a)  

a %= 2   # Equivalent to: a = a % 2
print(a) 

a **= 3  # Equivalent to: a = a ** 3
print(a)
